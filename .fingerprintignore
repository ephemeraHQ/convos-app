# Keep important native-affecting files by explicitly not ignoring them:
# - app.config.ts (affects native config)
# - eas.json (affects builds)
# - package.json (affects dependencies)
# - plugins/ (affects native code)
# - ios/ and android/ directories
# - babel.config.js (affects transforms)
# - metro.config.js (affects bundling)
