The following contains core principles for writing code in our codebase. Each principle is followed by a small example showing good and bad practices.

- Never assume the existence of functions, components, or features in third-party libraries.
- Always verify API usage in the official documentation for the major version being used in [package.json](mdc:package.json)
- A good way to find fixes is to go into the issues of a library Github repo and find if other people had similar issues.
- Check the [package.json](mdc:package.json) for the library version before implementing features.
