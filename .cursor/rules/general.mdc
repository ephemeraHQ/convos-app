This file contains core principles for writing code in our codebase. Each principle is followed by a small example showing good and bad practices.

- This codebase uses React Native - follow all React Native best practices.
- This project is a Chat app that uses the XMTP messaging protocol.
- When I ask you to "clean" a file, rewrite the content following the rules and best practices in this repository.
- When I ask you to "Make more readable", rewrite the content following our best practices and add concise comments to explain non-obvious code or implementation decisions.
- When I ask you to rename files, move files, or rename exports, ONLY perform the requested operation and update the corresponding import paths where needed - do not modify any other logic.
- When I ask you to extract code into separate files or components, ONLY move the code as is without modifying logic, features, styling, or creating additional components.
- When I ask to refactor or create external hooks, keep the hooks in the same file unless I explicitly ask to move them to a separate file.
- When I'm saying "Convo" or "Convos" it's the name of our app - not an abbreviation for Conversation.
